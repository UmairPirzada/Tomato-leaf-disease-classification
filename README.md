# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification
This project focuses on classifying tomato leaf diseases using deep learning models. The dataset contains over 20,000 images of tomato leaves, covering 10 diseases and a healthy class, collected from both laboratory and real-world environments. The goal is to develop a lightweight model deployable offline on mobile devices.
